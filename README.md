# What’s new in Swift 5.8?

This is an Xcode playground that demonstrates the new features introduced in Swift 5.8: 

* Lift all limitations on variables in result builders
* Function back deployment
* Allow implicit self for weak self captures, after self is unwrapped
* Concise magic file names
* Opening existential arguments to optional parameters
* Collection downcasts in cast patterns are now supported
